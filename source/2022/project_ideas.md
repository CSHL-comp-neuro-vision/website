Fits to frequency of seeing data to determine how quantum efficiency, dark light, and threshold can trade for each other (Teich et al., 1982, Multiplication noise in the human visual system at threshold 3. The role of non-Poisson quantum fluctuations).

Model of the phototransduction cascade elements to demonstrate how single events can be amplified. Determine how the phototransduction elements and amplification can be changed to account for rod vs. cone responses. Use this model to predict responses to different stimuli types (Angueyra et al., 2022 Predicting and manipulating cone responses to naturalistic inputs)

Model different motion detectors and determine how they might be distinguishable from each other (Bae et al., 2014, Space-timing wiring specificity supports direction selectivity in the retina)
