Computational approaches to neuroscience produce important advances in our understanding of neural processing. Prominent success comes in areas where strong inputs from neurobiological, behavioral and computational investigation interact. The theme of the course is that an understanding of the computational problems, the constraints on solutions to these problems, and the range of possible solutions can help guide research in neuroscience. Through a combination of lectures and hands-on experience with tutorials and projects, this intensive course examines visual information processing from the retina to higher cortical areas, spatial pattern analysis, motion analysis, neuronal coding and decoding, attention, and decision-making.
